Custom,MinimumPasswordLength,12,3,NIST800-53,IA-5,"Enforce minimum password length to 12 characters",High,Access Control,To remediate the IA-5 control, create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enforces a minimum password length of 12 characters by navigating to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy. Set the "Minimum password length" policy to 12 characters, and then link the GPO to the applicable Organizational Units (OUs) to enforce the policy. This GPO-based remediation will ensure that all users are required to have passwords that meet the minimum length requirement.

Custom,AuditLogonEvents,3,2,NIST800-53,AU-2,"Log both success and failure of all logon attempts",Medium,Audit,To remediate the AU-2 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables the "Audit logon events" policy setting, which will log both successful and failed logon attempts. This can be done by navigating to the "Computer Configuration" section of the GPO, then to "Windows Settings" > "Security Settings" > "Local Policies" > "Audit Policy" and configuring the "Audit logon events" setting to include both successes and failures. By applying this GPO to your organization's Active Directory, you can ensure compliance with the NIST 800-53 AU-2 control.

Finance,MinimumPasswordLength,12,3,PCI-DSS 8.2.3,IA-5,"Enforce minimum password length to 12 characters",High,Access Control,To remediate the IA-5 control, create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enforces a minimum password length of 12 characters by navigating to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy. Set the "Minimum password length" policy to 12 characters, and then link the GPO to the relevant Organizational Units (OUs) to apply the policy to all applicable systems. This GPO-based remediation will ensure compliance with the NIST 800-53 IA-5 control.
Finance,AuditLogonEvents,3,2,NIST800-53,AU-2,"Log both successful and failed logon attempts",Medium,Audit,To remediate the AU-2 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables the auditing of login events on your Windows systems. Specifically, you can navigate to the GPO's Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Logon/Logoff, and then enable the "Audit Logon" and "Audit Logoff" policies. By doing so, both successful and failed logon attempts will be logged, satisfying the AU-2 control requirement.
