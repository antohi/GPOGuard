    "ai_suggestion": "To remediate the IA-5 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enforces a minimum password length of 12 characters by navigating to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy. In the Password Policy settings, set the \"Minimum password length\" to 12 characters to ensure compliance with the NIST 800-53 control. This GPO-based remediation will apply the password length requirement to all computers in the scope of the GPO."
