Healthcare,EnableFirewall,1,MISSING,NIST800-53,SC-7,"Ensure host firewall is enabled",High,Boundary Protection,To remediate the NIST 800-53 control SC-7, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables the Windows Firewall on all hosts. This GPO can be configured to set the "Windows Firewall: Protect all network connections" policy to "Enabled" for both private and public profiles. By applying this GPO to your domain, you can ensure that the host firewall is enabled on all targeted systems, thereby satisfying the SC-7 control requirement.
Healthcare,AutoUpdate,Enabled,MISSING,NIST800-53,SI-2,"Automate OS security updates",Medium,Maintenance,To remediate the SI-2 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables the Windows Update service and configures it to automatically download and install security updates. This GPO can be applied to all domain-joined systems, ensuring consistent and automated application of OS security updates. Additionally, you can also use the GPO to schedule the installation of updates during a maintenance window to minimize disruptions.
Healthcare,EncryptFS,Enabled,MISSING,HIPAA 164.312(a),SC-13,"Encrypt file systems containing PHI",High,Encryption,To remediate the NIST 800-53 SC-13 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables BitLocker full-disk encryption on all systems storing Protected Health Information (PHI). This GPO can be applied to the relevant Organizational Units (OUs) in your Active Directory, ensuring that all affected systems have their file systems encrypted. By linking this GPO to the appropriate OUs, you can centrally manage and enforce disk encryption across your organization.

This GPO setting can be found under Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options. By applying this GPO to your domain, you can enforce auto-logout after inactivity for all affected systems.
