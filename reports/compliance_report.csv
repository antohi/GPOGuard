Finance,MinimumPasswordLength,12,3,PCI-DSS 8.2.3,IA-5,"Enforce minimum password length to 12 characters",High,Access Control,To remediate the IA-5 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that sets the "Minimum password length" to 12 characters under the "Password Policy" section. This GPO can be applied to all domain-joined systems, ensuring that all users have passwords that meet the minimum length requirement. By enforcing this policy, you can effectively satisfy the NIST 800-53 IA-5 control and enhance your organization's password security posture.
Finance,AuditLogonEvents,3,2,NIST800-53,AU-2,"Log both successful and failed logon attempts",Medium,Audit,To remediate the AU-2 control, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that enables the "Audit logon events" policy, which logs both successful and failed logon attempts. This can be done by navigating to the Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Logon/Logoff category in the GPO editor. By enabling the "Audit Logon" policy, you can ensure that all logon attempts are logged, helping to meet the requirements of the AU-2 control.
